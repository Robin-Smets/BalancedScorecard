# Balanced Scorecard

## Overview
Welcome to the **Balanced Scorecard** project! This application aims to provide valuable insights into company performance through advanced analytical features and dynamic visualizations. Inspired by the Balanced Scorecard concept, this tool will help organizations gather, analyze, and leverage data to develop effective strategies.

## Motivation
My interest in the Balanced Scorecard concept drives this project. I am passionate about data collection and analysis, as well as the development of actionable strategies based on these insights. During my internship at an ERP software company, I had the opportunity to work on a similar feature, which solidified my decision to pursue this topic further. 

This project is hosted in an open repository as a showcase of my programming skills. Currently I am looking for a job as a software developer with a specialization in analytical software, favourably in a scientific environment. If you are hiring for a position like that feel free to contact me.

## Future Directions
The roadmap for this project is still evolving. However, one certainty is that I plan to continue enhancing its features and capabilities. Stay tuned for updates!
